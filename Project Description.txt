Project Title: Crime Rate Analysis using Machine Learning and Spark

Project Description:

This project aims 
to develop a predictive model that can help law enforcement agencies to 
identify high crime areas and make informed decisions to prevent crime.

The project will involve collecting crime data from various sources, such 
as Chicago's open source data.We processed ETL on this Dataset in Spark.

Next, the project will use machine learning algorithms such as clustering, classification,
 and regression to analyze the data and identify patterns and trends in crime rates. The project
 will use Apache Spark, a distributed computing system, to analyze large datasets efficiently.


The project will also include data visualization techniques to present the analysis results 
in an intuitive and easy-to-understand format. This will help law enforcement agencies to quickly identify
 crime hotspots and take proactive measures to prevent crimes.
